                        <p><b>Screen Time ⏰ </b></p>
                        <p>Screen time self-limitation: You should limit yourself from using electronic devices 15-30 minutes before bedtime. This can prevent the blue light emitted by electronic devices from affecting sleep quality (Small et al., 2020)</p>
                        <p><b>Concentration Apps 🧠 </b></p>
                        <p>During working times, use concentration aid applications to help focus on your work and reduce the interference of entertainment apps and irrelevant notifications. Those apps could help you efficiently complete tasks and thus reduce screen usage time.</p>
                        <p><b>Substitution 📖</b></p>
                        <p>Replace electronic entertainment with other hobbies like hiking, sports, reading, and other activities that don’t need screens.</p>

                        <p>Every hour, stand up and take five slow, deep breaths to fully expand your lungs and prevent shallow breathing.</p>
                        <p><b>Outdoor Time 🌳</b></p>
                        <p>Spend at least 30 minutes outdoors daily; natural air movement and posture correction improve lung ventilation.</p>
                        <p><b>Stretch & Posture Alignment 🧘🏽‍♀️</b></p>
                        <p>Shoulder-opening stretches and gentle yoga improve chest expansion and airflow efficiency.</p>

                        <p>10-15 minutes meditation and breath regulation will be beneficial, enhancing the prefrontal lobe’s control of the amygdala(Center of stress and Emotion).</p>
                        <p><b>Social Support</b></p>
                        <p>When under pressure, talk to friends more often and have a meal or chat together to reduce stress appropriately</p>
                        <p><b>Time Management</b></p>
                        <p>Create a to-do list at the beginning of each week, prioritize tasks, and schedule time accordingly. This can avoid the situation where things pile up when the deadline approaches, effectively avoiding pressure accumulation.</p>

                        <p>Regular exercise: At least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking, cycling) per week, combined with strength training. Moderate exercise can relieve brain stress, reignite neuronal activity, and help people better engage in subsequent work. In addition, exercise can also help alleviate stress and anxiety.
