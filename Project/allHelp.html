                        <p><b>Zoning Out & Meditation</b></p>
                        <p>10-15 minutes meditation and breath regulation will be beneficial, enhancing the prefrontal lobe’s control of the amygdala(Center of stress and Emotion).</p>
                        <p><b>Social Support</b></p>
                        <p>When under pressure, talk to friends more often and have a meal or chat together to reduce stress appropriately</p>
                        <p><b>Time Management</b></p>
                        <p>Create a to-do list at the beginning of each week, prioritize tasks, and schedule time accordingly. This can avoid the situation where things pile up when the deadline approaches, effectively avoiding pressure accumulation.</p>

                        <p><b>Understand Harm</b></p>
                        <p>Understanding the harm of excessive alcohol consumption to the brain through scientific literature <i>(Eg. Moderate alcohol consumption as risk factor for adverse brain outcomes and cognitive decline: longitudinal cohort study. (Topiwala, et al. 2017))</i></p>
                        <p><b>Substitutes</b></p>
                        <p>Finding substitutes for Alcohol: Using anti-alcohol cocktail beverages to subsidize alcohol drinks during parties or social occasions. </p>
                        <p><b>Regulation</b></p>
                        <p>Self-limiting and regulation: Before drinking alcohol, set a clear limit for yourself. For example, making rules like “I think I must not drink up to 5 shots today”.</p>

                        <p><b>Screen Time</b></p>
                        <p>Screen time self-limitation: You should limit yourself from using electronic devices 15-30 minutes before bedtime. This can prevent the blue light emitted by electronic devices from affecting sleep quality(Small et al., 2020)</p>
                        <p><b>Concentration Apps</b></p>
                        <p>During working times, use concentration aid applications to help focus on your work and reduce the interference of entertainment apps and irrelevant notifications. Those apps could help you efficiently complete tasks and thus reduce screen usage time.</p>
                        <p><b>Substitution</b></p>
                        <p>Replace electronic entertainment with other hobbies like hiking, sports, reading, and other activities that don’t need screens.</p>

                        <p><b>Exercise</b></p>
                        <p>Regular exercise: At least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking, cycling) per week, combined with strength training. Moderate exercise can relieve brain stress, reignite neuronal activity, and help people better engage in subsequent work. In addition, exercise can also help alleviate stress and anxiety. (Cotman et al. 2002)</p>
                        <p><b>Get That Blood Circulating</b></p>
                        <p>After prolonged sitting at work, such as 45 minutes to an hour, get up and move your body. This can ensure smooth blood circulation, sufficient blood supply to the brain, and thus enhance cellular activity</p>
